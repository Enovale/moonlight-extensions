# Stream Quality Workaround

Depending on who's watching your stream and your stream quality, sometimes your stream's resolution will get lowered, 
and Discord does a bad job of bringing the resolution back up later.

This extension basically monitors the current quality of the stream and if it's low,
and refreshes the stream, forcing the quality to max (until it goes down again)
